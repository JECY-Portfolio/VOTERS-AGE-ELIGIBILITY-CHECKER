# Voter Eligibility Checker  

This is a **C# console application** that checks if a person is eligible to vote. The program prompts the user to enter their age and determines if they meet the voting age requirement (**18 years and above**).  

## Features  

✅ Accepts user input for age.  
✅ Validates input to ensure it is a **positive number**.  
✅ Determines **voting eligibility** based on the entered age.  
✅ Provides **clear and user-friendly messages**.  

## How It Works  

1. The user is asked to **enter their age**.  
2. The program **validates** the input to ensure it is a **positive number**.  
3. If the age is **18 or above**, the program prints:  
   _"You are eligible to vote."_  
4. If the age is **less than 18**, the program prints:  
   _"You are less than 18 years old and NOT eligible to vote."_
