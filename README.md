##Voter Eligibility Checker
This is a  C# console application that checks if a person is eligible to vote. The program prompts the user to enter their age and determines if they meet the voting age requirement (18 years and above).

Features
1. Accepts user input for age.
2. Validates input to ensure it is a positive number.
3. Determines voting eligibility based on the entered age.
4. Provides clear and user-friendly messages.

##How It Works
- The user is asked to enter their age.

- The program checks if the input is valid (a positive number).

- If the age is 18 or above, the program prints:
 "You are eligible to vote."

-If the age is less than 18, the program prints:
"You are less than 18 years old and NOT eligible to vote."
